# Airquality_RF_check

🌿 Air Quality Classification using Random Forest

📌 Overview : 

The Airquality_RF_check project is a Machine Learning-based classification system that predicts air quality levels based on various environmental factors. Using a Random Forest Classifier, the model analyzes pollutant concentrations and weather conditions to classify air quality into different categories.


This project focuses on :

  🧹 Cleaning and preprocessing real-world air quality data

  🌳 Training a Random Forest model for classification

  📊 Evaluating performance using multiple metrics 

  🌐 Deploying the model for real-time predictions
